# smile_detector_using_openCv
Implemented a smile detection system using OpenCV, a computer vision library, to recognize and analyze smiles in images or video streams. The project leverages pre-trained Haar cascades, including haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml, haarcascade_smile.xml, and haarcascade_eye.xml, for accurate and efficient face and smile detection.
